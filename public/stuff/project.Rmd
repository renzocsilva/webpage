## What I am up to? 

I have been involved in several data projects, but most of them won't see the light of the day. There are a few things though, mostly on the personal side, that I am eager to share - here you'll find a list of such projects.

### Hill Charts
- **Summary**: I have used this since the first day I came to know it via [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/features/hill-charts) - Hill Charts. It is an intuitive way to track the advance of a given task, from conception to completion, and nicely see a high-level moving picture of a project. See my [blog post]() and [source code](https://github.com/renzocsilva/hill_chart).

      <description>Context For reasons beyond the scope of this blog (see this publication, a follow up of my presentation at the GRC Organic Geochemistry 2018, I have done some serious data mining within the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geochemistry Database. Chatting with folks at a conference, I realized many organic geochemists did not know about this resource, and those who knew about it, never went up the hill to check for information nuggets it may contain.</description>

      <description>Context You may be managing a complex project or only focusing on specific tasks at hand. In research projects, the outcomes carry with them uncertainty - if one is a100% sure of its results, well, then don’t call it research. One specific consequence of this uncertainty is that: (a) it is hard to quantify progress on a given task (e.g. is it 75 or 80% completed?), (b) each task may generate n daughters, or even totally vanish after proved irrelevant before its completion.</description>

      <description>Why this post? This post is inspired by the nice (open access!) work of Wilson et al. (2017), in which a set of good enough practices in scientific computing is laid down.
Here I build on a subset of topics presented there, discuss a few key points, suggest external resources, and share personal experiences for those that have recognized the importance of changing their habits on research data management but are yet to take their first step in this journey.</description>

      <description>RIGHT ON TIME! I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about having a personal website for quite a while. Somewhere to host personal and professional ideas/experiences - aka brain dump - that may deserve seeing the light of day. If the material to be presented here becomes somewhat useful to other folks, then I&amp;rsquo;ll be closer to my main goal of contributing back to this lively community.
(Note: It is hard to pinpoint one specific theme I&amp;rsquo;ve been tapping knowledge from, e.</description>

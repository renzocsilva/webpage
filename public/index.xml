      <description>HOME - What I am up to? I have been involved in several data projects, but most of them won’t see the light of the day. There are a few things though, mostly on the personal side, that I am eager to share - here you’ll find a list of such projects.

      <description>WHAT I AM UP TO? I am eager to share a few experiments &amp;amp; side-projects I have developed over the year. I have also a large wish list of things to complete so expect here a mix of past and future.
HILL CHARTS  Summary: I have used Hill Charts since the first day I came to know it via Basecamp. It is an intuitive way to track the advance of a given task, from conception to completion, while having a high-level moving picture of a project.</description>

      <title>Research data management &amp; &#34;good enough&#34; practices</title>

      <description>Why this post? This post is inspired by the nice (open access!) work of Wilson et al. (2017), in which a set of good enough practices in scientific computing is laid down.
Here I build on a subset of topics presented there, discuss a few key points, suggest external resources, and share personal experiences for those that have recognized the importance of changing their habits of research data management, but have not taken their first step in this journey.</description>

      <description>RIGHT ON TIME! I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about having a personal website for quite a while. Somewhere to host personal and professional ideas/experiences - aka brain dump - that may deserve a dedicated outlet. If the material to be presented here becomes somewhat useful to other folks, then I&amp;rsquo;ll be closer to my main goal of contributing back to this lively community (Note: It is hard to pinpoint one specific theme I&amp;rsquo;ve been tapping knowledge from, e.</description>

      <description>IN A NUTSHELL With 12 years of proactive participation in industrially-funded R&amp;amp;D&amp;amp;I projects, I am enthusiastic about bridging academic and industrial resources to design, develop and deploy science-based solutions to real-world problems. I thrive on developing innovative analytical methods for complex mixture analysis, examining complex datasets, providing credible and meaningful assessments that create value for the project stakeholders, and presenting results in conferences, peer-reviewed papers or confidential reports. While pragmatic when dealing with the tasks at hand, innovation and groundbreaking thinking motivate me.</description>

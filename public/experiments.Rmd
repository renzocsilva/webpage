## <span style="color:darkred">WHAT I AM UP TO?</span>

I am eager to share a few experiments & side-projects I have developed over the year. I have also a large wish list of things to complete so expect here a mix of past and future. 

### <span style="color:darkred">HILL CHARTS</span>
- **Summary**: I have used Hill Charts since the first day I came to know it via [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/features/hill-charts). It is an intuitive way to track the advance of a given task, from conception to completion, while having a high-level moving picture of a project.
- **Where?**: See my [blog post]() and [source code](https://github.com/renzocsilva/hill_chart).

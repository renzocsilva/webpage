<h2>Context</h2>
<p>For reasons beyond the scope of this blog (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2019.103911">this publication</a>, a follow up of my presentation at the <a href="https://www.grc.org/organic-geochemistry-conference/2018/">GRC Organic Geochemistry 2018</a>, I have done some serious data mining within the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geochemistry Database. Chatting with folks at a conference, I realized many organic geochemists did not know about this resource, and those who knew about it, never went up <a href="https://renzocsilva.ca/posts/hill-charts-in-r/">the hill</a> to check for information nuggets it may contain.</p>
<p>The goal of this series of posts about the USGS Geochemistry Database is to quick-start anyone remotely interested in exploring it (using R).</p>

<div id="database-information" class="section level2">
<h2>Database information</h2>
<p>All you need to know from the USGS Geochemistry Database can be found <a href="https://certmapper.cr.usgs.gov/data/apps/geochem-db/">here</a>. The database contains (geo)chemical analyses data of (allegedly) 200,000+ crude oil, natural gas, coal, water, and rock samples. It is used mostly to assess the oil and gas potential of sedimentary basins.</p>
<p>The database was made public in a Microsoft Access format (.mdb) with ~ 400 Mb, and it is followed by a very useful excel file with relevant metadata and basic query instructions for those sticking with the Microsoft Access software.</p>

<div id="download-extract" class="section level2">
<h2>Download –&gt; Extract</h2>
<p>The only tricky part of accessing the database using R is the use of drivers from the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/RODBC/versions/1.3-15">RODBC</a> library that only work on the R 32-bit version.</p>
<p>Running the code below, you will end up with two newly created folders: <strong>raw_data</strong>, containing the downloaded zip file plus the extracted database (.mdb) and metadata (.xls) files; and <strong>extracted_data</strong>, containing the whole 2 tables present in the database as .csv files - analysis.csv @ 227 Mb and samples.csv @ 28 Mb, approximately. <strong>Note</strong> that these file sizes make their processing not a challenge for the modal (as opossed to the average) desktop/laptop. On larger datasets, we would be using database queries as inputs to our data analysis down the road.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>### Environment
library(RODBC)  ### Note: Must run on R 32-bits version

### User inputs
download_data &lt;- TRUE # Change to FALSE after 1st execution
extract_to_csv &lt;- TRUE # Change to FALSE after 1st execution

### Download and unzip
if (download_data == TRUE) {
  
  download.file(
    &quot;http://certmapper.cr.usgs.gov/data/geochem/tabular/EnergyGeochemistryPublicDB.zip&quot;,
    &quot;EnergyGeochemistryPublicDB.zip&quot;,
    mode = &quot;wb&quot;
  )
  
  unzip(&quot;EnergyGeochemistryPublicDB.zip&quot;,
        files = NULL,
        exdir = &quot;.&quot;)
  
  # Organizing folder - tip: make this raw_data folder read-only!
  file.rename(&quot;Energy Geochemistry Public DB&quot;, &quot;raw_data&quot;)
  file.copy(&quot;EnergyGeochemistryPublicDB.zip&quot;,
            &quot;./raw_data/EnergyGeochemistryPublicDB.zip&quot;)
  file.remove(&quot;EnergyGeochemistryPublicDB.zip&quot;)
}

### Extract to csv
if (extract_to_csv == TRUE) {

  dir.create(&quot;extracted_data&quot;)
  channel &lt;- odbcConnectAccess(&quot;./raw_data/Energy Geochemistry DB_9_2014.mdb&quot;)
  write.csv(sqlFetch(channel,&quot;Analysis&quot;), file = &quot;./extracted_data/analysis.csv&quot;)
  write.csv(sqlFetch(channel,&quot;Samples&quot;), file = &quot;./extracted_data/samples.csv&quot;)
  close(channel)
}</code></pre>

<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>It may not be a good idea to join the <strong>analysis</strong> and <strong>sample</strong> tables at this point. In Part II of this series, we’ll get to know the data better and proceed with some clean up.</p>

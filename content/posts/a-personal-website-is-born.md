title: A personal website is born!
---

## <span style="color:darkred">RIGHT ON TIME!</span>

I've been thinking about having a personal website for quite a while. Somewhere to host personal and professional **ideas/experiences** - aka brain dump - that may deserve **seeing the light of day**. If the material to be presented here becomes somewhat **useful** to other folks, then I'll be closer to my main goal of contributing back to this lively community  

*(Note: It is hard to pinpoint one specific theme I've been tapping knowledge from, e.g. R-Shiny + Linux etc., so please take this term 'community' in a broader sense)*  

My interests, combined with my experiences in programming and data tools (see these on ["About"](https://renzocsilva.ca/about)), will be the north of this blog. Regarding the [experiments section](http://renzocsilva.ca/project), I'd rather not make any promises at the moment... :smile:

Let's start with sharing (*and hopefully good karma!*): you can find the [R-Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) code used to build this website [here](https://github.com/renzocsilva/webpage), and the original Hugo theme I used [here](https://github.com/naro143/hugo-coder-portfolio).

On a side note, here is a big shout-out to a few folks whose content and creativity indirectly inspired this initiative [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/), [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name) and [Bruno Hildenbrand](https://blog.hildenco.com/).

**Cheers!**

## WHAT I AM UP TO?

I am eager to share a few experiments & side-projects I have developed over the years, and glad to have this space to fill with other projects-to-be.

### <span style="color:darkred">HILL CHARTS</span>


- **Summary**: I have used Hill Charts since the first day I came to know it through [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/features/hill-charts). It is an intuitive way to track the advance of a given task, from conception to completion, while having a high-level moving picture of a project.
- **Where?**: See my blog post [here](), source code [here](https://github.com/renzocsilva/hill_chart), and live app [here](https://renzocsilva.ca/hill).

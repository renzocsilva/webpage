# IN A NUTSHELL

---------------------------

With 12 years of proactive participation in industrially-funded R&D&I projects, I am enthusiastic about bridging academic and industrial resources to design, develop and deploy science-based solutions to real-world problems. I thrive on developing innovative analytical methods for complex mixture analysis, examining complex datasets, providing credible and meaningful assessments that create value for the project stakeholders, and presenting results in conferences, peer-reviewed papers or confidential reports. While pragmatic when dealing with the tasks at hand, innovation and groundbreaking thinking motivate me. I am a versatile professional navigating an ever-changing sea of knowledge. The unique skill set I have developed over these years is well-suited for most science-related endeavors. As a Sciencepreneur, I have invested time and energy to understand the nonconformities between current scientific practices and future technologies.

# <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> ACADEMIC  

---------------------------

- (2011-2014) **PhD in Chemistry (Analytical Geochemistry)**, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
- (2006-2008) **MSc in Chemistry (Chemistry and Natural Resources)**, Federal University of Espirito Santo, Brazil

# <i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> PROGRAMMING & DATA TOOLS
---------------------------
- With hindsight, early exposures to [LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) during elementary school, and [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) during high school have made me very comfortable with the concept of programming. Since 2018, I have invested time and effort to properly learn [R](https://www.r-project.org/), which has already brought good fruits both academically and professionaly. I have also learned to speak basic [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) and (minimal so far) [DAX - PowerBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis_expressions). 
- Regarding the statistical tools I have used: [Minitab](https://www.minitab.com/en-us/) in the good old days, [Matlab PLS_toolbox](http://eigenvector.com/software/pls-toolbox/) when things got serious, and recently **R** to push the boundaries of what is possible. I have working knowledge of the main supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.


# <i class="fas fa-heart"></i> INTERESTS

---------------------------

* Applied research and technology development.
* The complete lifecycle of data X-ing: designing, acquiring, storaging, transforming, processing, vizualizing, interpreting, concluding, deciding, reporting.
* New data tools & old scientific challenges (and vice versa).
* Philomathy (fɪlˈɒməθɪ):  an enjoyment of and passion for learning new facts and acquiring new knowledge.



# <i class="fas fa-globe-americas"></i> LIFE IN GENERAL

---------------------------
- I grew up and started college + work in *[Vitoria, Brazil](https://goo.gl/maps/Y5jS6HEP26ynv8nY6)*, then I lived in [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil](https://goo.gl/maps/73AC19M55C9snjZt9) during the first year of my PhD program (2011), then returned to Vitoria, finally ending up in [Calgary, Canada](https://goo.gl/maps/XgDptcfXQAwBRa4r6), where I have lived since 2014.
- We are in a beautiful family of 4, plus a Betta Fish named Magno after a folkloric Brazilian [politician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magno_Malta).

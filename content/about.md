# RENZO IN A NUTSHELL

---------------------------

With 12 years of proactive participation in industrially-funded R&D&I projects, I am enthusiastic about bridging academic and industrial resources to design, develop and deploy science-based solutions to real-world problems. I thrive on developing innovative analytical methods for complex mixture analysis, examining complex datasets, providing credible and meaningful assessments that create value for the project stakeholders, and presenting results in conferences, peer-reviewed papers or confidential reports. While pragmatic when dealing with the tasks at hand, innovation and groundbreaking thinking motivate me. I am a versatile professional navigating an ever-changing sea of knowledge. The unique skill set I have developed over these years is well-suited for most science-related endeavors. As a Sciencepreneur, I have invested time and energy to understand the nonconformities between current scientific practices and future technologies.

<h2><span style="color:darkred">WHAT I AM UP TO?</span></h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: I have used Hill Charts since the first day I came to know it via <a href="https://basecamp.com/features/hill-charts">Basecamp</a>. It is an intuitive way to track the advance of a given task, from conception to completion, while having a high-level moving picture of a project.</li>

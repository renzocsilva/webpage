<h2>WHAT I AM UP TO?</h2>
<p>I am eager to share a few experiments &amp; side-projects I have developed over the years, and glad to have this space to fill with other projects-to-be.</p>
<div id="hill-charts" class="section level3">
<h3><span style="color:darkred">HILL CHARTS</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: I have used Hill Charts since the first day I came to know it through <a href="https://basecamp.com/features/hill-charts">Basecamp</a>. It is an intuitive way to track the advance of a given task, from conception to completion, while having a high-level moving picture of a project.</li>
<li><strong>Where?</strong>: See my blog post <a href="">here</a>, source code <a href="https://github.com/renzocsilva/hill_chart">here</a>, and live app <a href="https://renzocsilva.ca/hill">here</a>.</li>

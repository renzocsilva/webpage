<h2>HOME - What I am up to?</h2>
<p>I have been involved in several data projects, but most of them won’t see the light of the day. There are a few things though, mostly on the personal side, that I am eager to share - here you’ll find a list of such projects.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: I have used this since the first day I came to know it via <a href="https://basecamp.com/features/hill-charts">Basecamp</a> - Hill Charts. It is an intuitive way to track the advance of a given task, from conception to completion, and nicely see a high-level moving picture of a project. See my <a href="">blog post</a> and <a href="https://github.com/renzocsilva/hill_chart">source code</a>.</li>
